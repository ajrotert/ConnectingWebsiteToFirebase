<h1>About FireChat</h1>
<p>Starting as a project, FireChat is now being hosted. The idea of FireChat was to explore,
    and use Google's Firebase Realtime Databases. It has now evolved to be a simple chat website.
    Any user can add information into the database, where it then becomes visible for all clients
    who are connected. To begin, enter a username that will be displayed and a name.</p>
